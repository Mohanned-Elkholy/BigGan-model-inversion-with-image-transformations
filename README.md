# BigGan-model-inversion-with-image-transformations
Model inversion has been one of the hot topics recently in deep learning. This the torch implementation of The idea behind model inversion is find the closest image generated by a one of the state of the art generators to a given image. In most of the cases, the BigGan generator (https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11096) is used for this problem

# Goal of the project
In real life applications, it is practically difficult to keep the balance in the data instances. The goal of the project is to use the recent advances in generative models to tackle this problem. Since generative models are robust in producing realistic images using only a random vector, this repo is about finding the closest latent representation to a specific image (as well as some transformations) and optimizing the generation process of the images of interest by having control over this random vector. 

# Advanced data augmentation using transformations in the latent space
Applying certain image transformations (like sliding left or right, center crop,..etc) are usually discrete and the image as a whole lacks continuity in some filters (like zero-padding). Applying this transformations in the latent space, however, is different. Because generative models are trained to produce realistic images, applying the transformation in the latent space ensures the realisticity of the produced image after its augmentation. This data augmentation technique can be crucial in improving the accuracy of image classifiers.
