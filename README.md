# BigGan-model-inversion-with-image-transformations
Model inversion has been one of the hot topics recently in deep learning. This the torch implementation of (https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07171) .The idea behind model inversion is to find the closest image generated by a one of the state of the art generators to a given image. In most of the cases, the BigGan generator (https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11096) is used for this problem

# Advanced data augmentation using transformations in the latent space
It has been known that applying certain image transformations (like sliding left or right, center crop,..etc) are usually discrete and the image as a whole lacks continuity in some filters (like zero-padding). Applying this transformations in the latent space, however, is different. Because generative models are trained to produce realistic images, applying the transformation in the latent space ensures the realisticity of the produced image after its augmentation. In this repo, multiple transformations are done to a given image in the latent space of the BigGan generator. This data augmentation technique can be crucial in improving the accuracy of image classifiers.
